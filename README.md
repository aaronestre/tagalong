### Introduction
**Tagalong** is a web application that helps users learn Tagalog through AI-powered tutoring and vocabulary flashcards. It features an interactive chat system backed by Groq API and a vocabulary module with text-to-speech functionality using ElevenLabs API.

I wanted to create my own dicitionary of Tagalog vocabulary words in order to use for my other project, **Tagalong**. With this data, I can update a database with the words so that I can then make flashcards to learn from.
